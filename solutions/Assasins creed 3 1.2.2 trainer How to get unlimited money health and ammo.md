Assassin's Creed 3 is not just a historical game, but also a personal one. You get to witness the growth and struggles of Connor as he tries to balance his loyalty to his people and his quest for justice. You also get to see the perspectives of other characters, such as Haytham Kenway, Connor's father and a Templar leader, and Desmond Miles, the modern-day descendant of both Connor and Haytham who relives their memories through the Animus device. The story is complex and engaging, with twists and turns that will keep you hooked until the end.
 
However, Assassin's Creed 3 is not without its flaws. The game suffers from some technical issues, such as glitches, bugs, and long loading times. Some of the missions are also repetitive or frustrating, requiring you to follow strict objectives or stealth sequences that can easily fail. The combat system is improved from previous games, but still feels clunky and unresponsive at times. The game also has a lot of filler content that can distract you from the main story or feel overwhelming.
 
Despite these drawbacks, Assassin's Creed 3 is still a remarkable achievement that offers a rich and immersive experience. The game showcases the beauty and diversity of colonial America, from the bustling cities to the wild frontier to the open sea. The game also features a multiplayer mode that lets you compete or cooperate with other players in various modes and maps. The game is a must-play for fans of the series and anyone who enjoys historical action-adventure games.
