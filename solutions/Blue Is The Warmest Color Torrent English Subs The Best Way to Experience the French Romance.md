Blue Is The Warmest Color stars AdÃ¨le Exarchopoulos as AdÃ¨le, a high school student who discovers her sexuality and falls in love with Emma, a blue-haired art student played by LÃ©a Seydoux. The film was directed by Abdellatif Kechiche, who also co-wrote the screenplay with Ghalia Lacroix. The film received critical acclaim and won several awards, including the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival, where it was the first film to be awarded to both the director and the lead actresses.
 
However, the film also sparked controversy and criticism for its portrayal of lesbian sexuality, its graphic sex scenes, and its working conditions. The author of the graphic novel, Julie Maroh, said that she felt the film was "a brutal and surgical display" of sex that missed the "soul" of her work. The lead actresses also complained about the long and exhausting shooting schedule and the pressure from the director. Kechiche defended his artistic vision and said that he wanted to show "the beauty and universality of love".
