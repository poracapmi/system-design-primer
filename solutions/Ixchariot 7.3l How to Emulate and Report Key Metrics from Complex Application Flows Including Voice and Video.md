# IxChariot 7.3: A Powerful Tool for Network Performance Assessment
 
IxChariot is a software-based network simulator that can instantly assess and troubleshoot networks and applications before and after deployment. It uses software agents called Performance Endpoints to simulate application traffic and deliver key performance metrics to a central console for easy management. IxChariot can emulate a blend of real-world application traffic used on todayâs networks, such as OTT video like Netflix and YouTube, and measure metrics such as throughput, packet loss, jitter, delay, and MOS. IxChariot can also test the performance of wireless networks and geo-location services.
 
In this article, we will introduce the features and benefits of IxChariot 7.3, the latest version of this powerful tool. We will also show you how to use it to test the performance of your network and applications.

## What's New in IxChariot 7.3?
 
IxChariot 7.3 is the latest release of IxChariot, which was launched in June 2020 by Keysight Technologies, a leading provider of network test and security solutions. IxChariot 7.3 offers several enhancements and improvements over the previous versions, such as:
 
- A new user interface that is more intuitive and user-friendly.
- A new dashboard that provides a quick overview of the test results and status.
- A new report generator that allows you to create customized reports with charts and tables.
- A new endpoint manager that simplifies the deployment and management of Performance Endpoints across different platforms and devices.
- A new AppLibrary that contains more than 100 predefined application scripts that can be used to emulate realistic network traffic.
- A new XRPi Active Monitoring Probe that can be used to monitor the performance of remote networks and devices.
- A new integration with Vision Edge 1S, a network packet broker that can capture and analyze network traffic for troubleshooting and optimization.

## How to Use IxChariot 7.3?
 
To use IxChariot 7.3, you need to install the IxChariot Server on a Windows or Linux machine that acts as the central console for managing the tests. You also need to install Performance Endpoints on the devices or platforms that you want to test, such as mobile phones, PCs, Macs, or cloud services. You can use the endpoint manager to deploy and configure the endpoints remotely.
 
Once you have installed the server and endpoints, you can create a test scenario by selecting the endpoints, the application scripts, and the test parameters. You can use the predefined scripts from the AppLibrary or create your own scripts using the Script Editor. You can also customize the test parameters such as duration, bandwidth, packet size, etc.
 
After creating the test scenario, you can run the test and monitor the progress and results on the dashboard. You can see various metrics such as throughput, packet loss, jitter, delay, MOS, etc. for each endpoint pair. You can also see graphs and charts that show the trends and distribution of the metrics over time.
 
When the test is completed, you can generate a report that summarizes the test results and provides detailed analysis and recommendations. You can choose from different report templates or create your own template using the Report Editor. You can also export the report in various formats such as PDF, HTML, CSV, etc.
