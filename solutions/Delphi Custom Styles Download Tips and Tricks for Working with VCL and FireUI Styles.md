# How to Download and Apply Custom Styles for Delphi Applications
 
Delphi is a powerful and versatile programming language that allows you to create stunning user interfaces for your applications. One of the features that makes Delphi stand out is the ability to apply custom styles to your forms and controls, giving them a unique and modern look.
 
Custom styles are files that define the appearance of various elements of your application, such as buttons, menus, edit boxes, etc. You can create your own custom styles using the Bitmap Style Designer tool that comes with Delphi, or you can download ready-made custom styles from various sources online.

Alternatively, you can search for custom styles on Google or other search engines using keywords like "delphi custom styles download", "delphi vcl styles download", "delphi firemonkey styles download", etc. You will find many results from various sources, such as blogs, forums, GitHub repositories, etc.
 
Once you find a custom style that you like, download it to your computer. Usually, custom styles are packaged in ZIP or RAR files that contain one or more .vsf (VCL Style File) or .style (FireMonkey Style File) files. These are the files that you need to apply to your application.
 
## Step 2: Copy Custom Styles to Your Project Folder
 
The next step is to copy the custom style files (.vsf or .style) to your project folder. This is the folder where your Delphi project file (.dproj) is located. You can create a subfolder inside your project folder to store your custom style files, such as "Styles" or "Themes".
 
For example, if your project file is located at C:\Users\YourName\Documents\Delphi Projects\MyApp\MyApp.dproj, you can copy your custom style files to C:\Users\YourName\Documents\Delphi Projects\MyApp\Styles.
 
## Step 3: Add Custom Styles to Your Project Options
 
The final step is to add the custom style files to your project options. This will tell Delphi to include them in your application executable and make them available for selection at runtime.
 
To do this, open your project in Delphi and go to Project -> Options -> Application -> Appearance. Here you will see a list of available styles for your application. Click on the Add button and browse to the folder where you copied your custom style files. Select the ones that you want to add and click Open. You will see them added to the list of available styles.
 
You can also change the default style for your application by selecting it from the drop-down menu under Default Style. This will make your application use this style when it starts.
 
## Step 4: Apply Custom Styles to Your Forms and Controls
 
Now that you have added the custom style files to your project options, you can apply them to your forms and controls at design time or runtime.
 
To apply a custom style at design time, select a form or a control in the Form Designer and go to Object Inspector -> Properties -> StyleName. Here you will see a drop-down menu with all the available styles for your application. Select the one that you want to apply and you will see the form or control change its appearance accordingly.
 
To apply a custom style at runtime, you can use the TStyleManager class from the Vcl.Themes unit (for VCL applications) or the TStyleBook component from the FMX.Styles unit (for FireMonkey applications). These classes allow you to load and apply custom styles dynamically from code.
 
For example, if you want to load and apply a custom style called "DarkBlue.vsf" from the Styles subfolder of your project folder
