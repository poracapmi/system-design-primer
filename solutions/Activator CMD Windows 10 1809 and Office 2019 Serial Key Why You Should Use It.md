- Make sure you have an internet connection while running Activator CMD. This is necessary for connecting to the KMS server and validating the activation.
- Disable any antivirus or firewall software that might block Activator CMD from running or accessing the internet. Some security programs might detect Activator CMD as a malicious or suspicious file and prevent it from working properly.
- Run Activator CMD as an administrator. This is required for modifying the system files and registry entries that are involved in the activation process.
- If you get an error message saying "Sorry, your version is not supported", it means that your Windows or Office edition is not compatible with Activator CMD. You can check the supported editions in the readme.txt file that comes with Activator CMD.
- If you get an error message saying "Connection to KMS server failed", it means that Activator CMD could not connect to the KMS server for some reason. You can try changing the KMS server address in activator.cmd by editing it with Notepad. You can find some alternative KMS server addresses online or use your own if you have one.
